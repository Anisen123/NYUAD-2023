Amaan is arabic word for safety and we aim to work towards the third sustainable development goal which is good health and well being. During catastrophes and emergencies, our quantum algorithm, based on QAOA, optimizes the placement of scarce resources by minimizing the time for citizens to reach them.

The main file contains our code for the hackthon.

VertexCoverQAOA.ipynb contains the QAOA (Quantum Alternating Operator Ansatz) implementation for the maximum k-vertex cover problem, which models the selection of safe zones in the city.

ClassicalCode.ipynb contains the classical brute force implementation for the same problem.
